# 🎮 Sequence Memory Challenge Game

The *Sequence Game* is a classic *memory and pattern recognition* challenge where players repeat an ever-growing sequence of colors (or sounds).  
It’s designed to test *memory, **attention, and **focus* — inspired by the timeless Simon Says game.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. *Game Start:*  
   The game begins by lighting up *one random color* (or playing one sound).

2. *Player Response:*  
   The player must *press the same color button* in the correct order.

3. *Sequence Growth:*  
   If the player is correct, the game *adds one new color* to the sequence.

4. *Game Over:*  
   If the player presses the *wrong color, the game ends and displays the **final score*.

## 🧩 Key Components

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|

| 🧾 *Sequence Storage* | The system stores the generated sequence internally for comparison. |
| 🎯 *Player Input* | The player’s input is validated against the stored sequence. |
| 🏆 *Score System* | The score increases as the player correctly recalls longer sequences. |

## 🔊 Beeps and Sounds

Each color can have a *unique beep tone*, improving memory association and adding a fun audio cue to the game.
